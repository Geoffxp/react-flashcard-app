# Flashcard-O-Matic

This is a React web app that displays flashcards for studying.
The app has a variety of features and is very user friendly.

## How does it work?

This app makes use of the Router method in React.
Clicking on different sections of the page render new pages with the appropriate content.
The Route method declares the url path and then which components will be rendered.
Buttons and links meant to take you to new pages are replaced with the `<Link to="/yourPathHere">' tag.
The program makes API fetch calls and HTTP requests to get, update, and add decks / cards.
The design is made possible by twitter bootstrap and sfont awesome icons.
